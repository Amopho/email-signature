              In emails one may use inline css or Style tags. External resources are allowed, but email client spam filters would block that, so separate css files links are not permitted. This ensures the static nature of emails- they shouldn't change from one day to another.

              An email signature suppose to be a small, static element. So an html table is optional. In this case, 1 row with 3 columns have been used. 
            </li>
            <li>
              The center row is optional, since the coral border could have been applied to the last column with some extra padding-left to achieve the same affect. Extra portion of freedom at minimal the cost.
            </li>
            <li>
              The graphics tend to be bigger than the display size. This creates better appearance on uhd monitors. 
            </li>
            <li>Links were added. The standard text-decoration doesn't match the design style, Icons to indicate clickability. Phone number is clickable as a convenience for call-able devices.</li>
          </ul>
